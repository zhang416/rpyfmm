Installation Instruction for RPYFMM

-- Prerequisites --

RPYFMM depends on two external libraries: HPX-5 and DASHMM. Users must first
install HPX-5 on their systems. The current version of RPYFMM depends on version
4.1.0 of HPX-5 or later, which can be found at https://hpx.crest.iu.edu/. Please
see the official documentation for instructions on how to build, install, and
run HPX-5 on your system. Once HPX-5 is installed, DASHMM is automatically
downloaded by RPYFMM when the library is built. 

-- Building RPYFMM --

The RPYFMM library uses CMake for its build system and so CMake of version at
least 3.4 is required. To build RPYFMM, perform the following steps. 

1) Unpack the source code into some convenient directory. For the sake of
discussion, this guide assumes that the code has been unpacked in
/path/to/rpyfmm. 

2) Create a directory in which to build RPYFMM. For the sake of discussion,
assume that this is /path/to/rpyfmm/build

3) From that directory, run 
> cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/rpyfmm/install

4) Run `make` from /path/to/rpyfmm/build

5) Run `make install` from /path/to/rpyfmm/build. This will install the library
and the header files in the specified place. 

-- RPYFMM demo program --

A demonstration program is included with RPYFMM. The source code is found in the
/path/to/rpyfmm/demo subfolder. The demonstration program is not built/installed
by make install. To build it, run `make demo` in /path/to/rpyfmm/build/demo. The
demo code creates a random distribution of beads and computes the
Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa interaction. User can request a summary of the options to
the demo code by running the code with `--help` as a command line argument.
