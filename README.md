# RPYFMM 

RPYFMM computes the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor using the adaptive Fast Multipole Method (FMM). The implementation leverages the Dynamic Adaptive System for Hierarchical Multipole Methods (DASHMM) infrastructure and operates on both shared and distributed memory architectures. 

Installation instruction can be found in INSTALL. An demonstration program can be found in demo/ subfolder. 

RPYFMM was created at the Center for Research in Extreme Scale Technologies (CREST) and Indiana University, and was supported by the National Science Foundation.
